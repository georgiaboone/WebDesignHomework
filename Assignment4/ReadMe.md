1.) Web browsers work by interpreting web languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript to render the intended web pages. When you enter a web address, your browser send a request to the necessary server. When this happens, the server will respond with the necessary files, documents or images. Your browser will then process these files and images to display the content. These will be formatted according to the instructions on the HTML and CSS. Javascript is a bit more complex, and requires an interpreter. There is also something called data storage which includes things like cookies and local storage which help enhance the browsing experience and save user data.  

2.) Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents these documents in a heirarchical tree structure, where each node respresents a particalar part of a document. The DOM allows developers to connect style wants with appropriate structural elements.  

3.) **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. **XML** (Extensible Markup Language) is a compliment to HTML, but describes document nodes, while HTML displays them. **XHTML** (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) is a combination between both HTML and XML. It has stricter code requirements which make it harder to write but easier to maintain. 

4.) The 4 elements your HTML pages need are: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head> and <body>.

5.) The index is a master HTML file. It serves as a default entry point on a website. It is typically the homepage of a site.
