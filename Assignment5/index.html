            1. The Outsiders
            
            A teen gang in rural Oklahoma, the Greasers are perpetually at odds with the Socials, a rival group. 
            When Greasers Ponyboy (C. Thomas Howell) and Johnny (Ralph Macchio) get into a brawl that ends in the 
            death of a Social member, the boys are forced to go into hiding. Soon Ponyboy and Johnny, along with 
            the intense Dallas (Matt Dillon) and their other Greaser buddies, must contend with the consequences 
            of their violent lives. While some Greasers try to achieve redemption, others meet tragic ends.

            3. Where the Crawdads Sing
          
            Abandoned as a girl, Kya raised herself in the dangerous marshlands of North Carolina. For years, rumors 
            of the marsh girl haunted Barkley Cove, isolating the sharp and resilient Kya from her community. Drawn 
            to two young men from town, she opens herself to a new and startling world. However, when one of them is 
            found dead, Kya immediately becomes the main suspect. As the case unfolds, the verdict as to what happened 
            becomes increasingly unclear, threatening to reveal many secrets.
